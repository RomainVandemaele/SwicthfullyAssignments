    <h1>Links</h1>

    <p>This example is about links and <a href="images.html">images</a></p>

    <p>This particular page is about links! There are 3 kinds of links</p>


    <ul>
        <li>Absolute links, like to
            <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML' target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very good resource for webdevelopers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Relative links, like to our <a href="misc/extras.html">extras</a>.
        </li>
        <!-- this won't work here because we are working in local env-->
        <li>
            Root-relative links, like to the <a href='/'>home page</a> of our website,
    but those aren't useful to us right now.
        </li>
    </ul>
