        <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
        <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML</p>

        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>Heading defines the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings</p>

        <h2>Lists</h2>

        <ul>
            <li> <p>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list) </p> </li>
            <li> Add each item in its own "li" element </li>
            <li> They don't need to be in any particular order </li>
        </ul>

        <p> This is what an ordered list looks like</p>


        <ol>
            <li> Notices the new "ol" element wrapping  everything </li>
            <li> But, the list item element are the same </li>
            <li> Also notethe  numbers increments on their own  </li>
            <li> You  should be noticing things is this precise order because this is anordered list </li>
        </ol>
